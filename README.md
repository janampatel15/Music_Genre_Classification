# Music_Genre_Classification

 Music Genre Classification for the GTZAN dataset using ANN and CNN models

For our code, it's best if viewed or ran as Jupyter Notebook or Google Collab.

There are multiple files in this zip folder. The file description of files are as follows.

1. requirment.txt contains all the modules and their version number used in this project.
2. Generate_img.ipynb and Generate_img.py generate melspectrogram images for all the audio files.
3. ANN-N.ipynb contains our models of ANN architecture.
4. CNN.ipynb contains our convolutional model that works well for grayscale images.
5. CNN_keras.ipynb contains our convolutional model that was made using Keras to work with RGB images.
6. ML.ipynb contains our Machine Learning mode that uses GridSearch
7. 30_sec.png and 3_sec.png are images of our graph that show loss and variation of accuracy, for 30 seconds and 3 seconds feature's data.
8. 30sec_report.html, and 3sec_report.html are html report generated using Pandas Profiling.
9. new_main_class.py contains our main classes and important functions used by our models.
10. score.csv contains choice of epochs, eta, layers, and score and how they different. The csv file has it for 30 seconds and 3 seconds feature.
